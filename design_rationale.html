                <h2 class="col-12 text-center tm-section-title">Design Rationale</h2>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">As our project design is heavily dependent on database ETL, near real time update data for client, integration between client and server. We decided and chose two design(s) for system, Pipe and filter, and Client-Server architecture design.
                    As we are receiving unstructured data from a data warehouse, we have to perform so much cleaning on data, in order to make meaningful data so that we decided to go with pipe and filter architecture to achieve this problem. As data
                    cleanse can run in parallel we are planning to introduce multiple filters that can be implemented as separate tasks and run in a concurrent fashion. On the other hand, we have user interaction, where they are viewing different maps
                    on a website, and the website is making REST API calls to the backend server to fulfill the user request, so we choose Client-Server architecture. This allows our application to be fully decoupled from backend and frontend clients
                    can be hosted on different platforms by using the same backend REST API’s.
                    <br><br>

                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Resiliency and Availability</h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">ETL processes are likely to fail because of connection failures, not enough resources available on the system etc. As ETL process in our application is critical, and time-sensitive operation, failures on this process can provide inconvenience
                    on the downstream flow of application. Therefore, we are designing resilience in our ETL process so if there are connection failures, the system will keep retrying to connect for a certain period of time. At 99.9% time, this method
                    works and provides zero downtime and prevents data loss. We are also having failover machines in case the main machine is down due to any unexpected system outage.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Performance</h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">Performance will be the key point to make the success of this application. As users are expecting to see 2D and 3D map views of the buildings, which requires different data points from the server(backend) system and making the map on the
                    fly on the server side. API response time should be faster(~150ms) for interactive sessions for users. In order to achieve this, we are having region based backend servers and the request will go to the performance base region( for
                    example, if request is initiated from east region, load balancer will route the request to east backend server to get faster response. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Integrity</h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">Integrity will be built into the app from the start and is reinforced by the application architecture that was chosen. This will be done by building modular pieces of code which can be unit tested separately. The pipe and filter architecture
                    allows for this as each filter can be an individual procedure. The client server architecture allows for modularization as well, the API’s can be tested separately. The client server will also allow for the program to be easy to understand
                    in a logical manner as it is a fairly common application design. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Security</h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">Security Vulnerability occurs a lot in today’s real world applications because of lack of security design for applications. This application will use VT LDAP and OAUTH token service to secure the application. Moreover, we are providing
                    nginx-ingress design to secure backend servers where applications will run and query the data.
