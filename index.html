                <p class="col-12 text-left">Campus Population Map
                </p>

                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Objective</h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">The purpose of this project is to develop the architecture of a system to visualize the campus population using 2D and 3D map visualizations. In this project we will design an architecture for a system for displaying Virginia Tech campus
                    population density.
                </p>
                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Problem</h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">There is a need to estimate and visualize the campus population distribution to inform on sanitization and cleaning decisions to limit the spread of COVID-19. The population information is also helpful in making better decisions with regards
                    to emergency management.
                </p>
                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Background</h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">The identification of campus population at-risk for certain hazard/emergency (terrorism, fire, COIVID-19 response, etc.) is critical for making mitigation/evacuation strategies for Virginia Tech emergency management. Knowing the near-real
                    time population distribution across the campus is beneficial for decision making in effective response and resource allocation. A wireless access point (AP) is a network hardware device that allows devices to connect to a wired network.
                    Its physical location along with the device connection information have potential to be used to estimate and map nearby populations. Using available campus AP connection data, we will be able to design the architecture of a web application
                    to visualize the campus population in two-dimensional (2D) and in three-dimensional (3D) space.
                </p>
                <h3 class="col-12 text-left">Relevance </h3>
                <p class="col-12 text-left">As we find ourselves in the middle of a global pandemic we need tools to help with the management of current predicament. With college campuses open, it is essential that measures are taken to limit the spread of COVID-19. One such way
                    is to sanitize campus spaces regularly. As the sanitization and facilities resources of Virginia Tech are limited, the entire campus cannot be sanitized every day, consequently, we need a way to identify areas of the campus that are
                    frequently used making them more susceptible for spreading the virus. The data from this system will help identify the populated areas on campus and sanitization resources and efforts can be directed towards these high risk areas to
                    combat the spread of COVID-19. The application we are planning to design will provide an easy way to view the campus population data and it will provide insights beneficial to emergency management situations. In emergencies (campus
                    fire, earthquake, school shooting, etc.), Virginia Tech Emergency Management employees can use our system to identify highly populated areas of the campus and prioritize evacuation efforts based on this information.
